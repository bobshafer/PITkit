### Appendix B: Coherence Cosmology and the Emergence of Time

#### B.1 The Cosmological θ Field Equation

In an FLRW metric, the coherence field `θ(t)` evolves according to:

$$\ddot{\theta} + 3H(t)\dot{\theta} + V'(\theta) = \alpha R(t)$$

#### B.2 The Three Acts of Cosmic Coherence

The solutions to this equation divide cosmic history into three epochs:

  * **Act I: The Great Roll (Inflation):** `θ` slowly rolls from `θ≈0` to `θ=v`, driving exponential expansion.
  * **Act II: The Ringing of the Cosmos (Reheating):** `θ` oscillates around `v`, creating particles and stabilizing physical constants.
  * **Act III: The Quiet Hum (Dark Energy):** `θ` settles into its vacuum `v`, with `V₀` driving late-time acceleration.

#### B.3 The Hubble Tension and Evolving Constants

The Hubble Tension is resolved by recognizing that the effective gravitational constant is a function of `θ`:

$$G_{eff}(\theta) = \frac{G}{1 + 16\pi G \alpha \theta}$$

Measurements of the early universe (Act II) and late universe (Act III) probe different values of `θ` and thus different values of `G_eff`, explaining the discrepancy.

#### B.4 Entropy

The second law of thermodynamics may find a new foundation in PIT, where the increase in entropy reflects the ever-growing complexity and information encoded in the history of the coherence field's evolution.

### Appendix C: Cosmological History Diagram

The "Three Acts" of cosmic coherence can be visualized with a diagram that maps the evolution of the universe's scale against the evolution of the coherence field `θ(t)`.

**Figure 1: A stylized diagram of the cosmological history in PIT.** Time flows upwards. The diagram begins with a **Resolved Initial State**, replacing the classical singularity. This leads into the inflationary **Great Roll** epoch, where the universe expands exponentially as `θ` rolls towards its stable vacuum value `v`. This is followed by the **Ringing** epoch, where `θ` oscillates around `v`, reheating the universe and emitting the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB). Finally, the universe enters the **Quiet Hum**, the current era of gentle, dark-energy-driven acceleration as `θ` settles into its vacuum. The overlaid plot shows the behavior of `θ(t)` during these phases.
