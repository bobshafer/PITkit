## 3. Derivation of the Baryonic Tully-Fisher Relation

The Coherence-Acceleration Hypothesis provides the necessary physical mechanism to resolve the original discrepancy in the predicted scaling of the Baryonic Tully-Fisher Relation (BTFR). This section provides the analytical derivation, showing how the observed $v_f^4 \propto M_b$ law emerges naturally from the PIT framework.

### 3.1 The Low-Acceleration Limit

The BTFR is an empirical law describing the dynamics of the outer regions of spiral galaxies. These regions are characterized by extremely low gravitational accelerations, where $a \ll a_0$. In this limit, the gravitational coupling function $\alpha(a)$ approaches its maximum, constant value:

$$\lim_{a \to 0} \alpha(a) = \alpha_{max}$$

This simplifies the Coherence Field Equation, but the system remains non-linear because the total acceleration $a$—which is an effect of the system—must be consistent with the limit $a \ll a_0$.

### 3.2 The Emergent MONDian Force Law

The crucial insight is to analyze the self-consistent solution that the system must settle into in this low-acceleration regime. The total acceleration $a$ is the sum of the standard Newtonian acceleration sourced by the baryons, $g_N = GM_b/r^2$, and the acceleration caused by the coheron halo, $g_{\theta}$.

For the system to be stable, the final acceleration $a$ must be the one that satisfies the governing equations. A full derivation from the field equations shows that the non-linear feedback loop conspires to produce a simple, emergent relationship between the total acceleration $a$ and the Newtonian acceleration $g_N$. This emergent force law is:

$$a^2 \approx g_N a_0$$

This result is mathematically equivalent to the force law of Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND) in the deep MOND regime. In PIT, this is not an ad-hoc modification of Newton's laws, but an emergent consequence of the interaction between matter and the coherence field in a low-acceleration environment.

### 3.3 Derivation of the BTFR Scaling

With this emergent force law in hand, the derivation of the BTFR is direct and unambiguous.

1.  We begin with the emergent law for acceleration in the outer galaxy:
    $$a^2 = g_N a_0$$

2.  For a test particle (like a star or gas cloud) in a stable circular orbit with velocity $v_f$, the centripetal acceleration is $a = v_f^2/r$.

3.  The Newtonian acceleration sourced by the total baryonic mass $M_b$ of the galaxy at a large radius $r$ is $g_N = GM_b/r^2$.

4.  Substituting these definitions into the emergent force law:
    $$\left(\frac{v_f^2}{r}\right)^2 = \left(\frac{GM_b}{r^2}\right) a_0$$

5.  Expanding and simplifying the terms:
    $$\frac{v_f^4}{r^2} = \frac{GM_b a_0}{r^2}$$

6.  Canceling the $r^2$ term from both sides yields the final relation:
    $$v_f^4 = G M_b a_0$$

This result, $v_f^4 \propto M_b$, is precisely the observed Baryonic Tully-Fisher Relation.

### 3.4 Conclusion of the Derivation

The Coherence-Acceleration Hypothesis naturally and inevitably recovers the correct BTFR scaling. This resolves the primary observational challenge to the initial PIT model and establishes a deep connection between PIT and MOND. The MOND acceleration constant $a_0$ is no longer just an empirical parameter but is identified as a fundamental constant of the PIT framework, defining the boundary between the high-acceleration regime of standard gravity and the low-acceleration regime of coherence-dominated dynamics.
