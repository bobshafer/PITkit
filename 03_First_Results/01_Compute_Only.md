## 3. First Results: The SPARC Gauntlet and the Solar System Test

With the theoretical framework of the **Coherence-Acceleration Hypothesis** established, we proceed to the two most critical validation tests of the theory. The first is a rigorous confrontation with galactic-scale observational data, which we call the "SPARC Gauntlet." The second is a crucial "sanity check" to ensure the theory is compatible with the high-precision gravitational tests in our own solar system. As we show here, Participatory Interface Theory (PIT) passes both tests successfully.

### 3.1 A Universal Law: The Global Fit to the SPARC Sample

The core prediction of the Coherence-Acceleration Hypothesis is that the acceleration constant, $a_0$, is a **universal constant of nature**. To test this, we created a "global fitter" program to analyze the data from the entire SPARC sample of ~175 diverse galaxies.

The program works by finding the single value of $a_0$ that provides the best possible fit across all galaxies simultaneously. For each proposed universal $a_0$, the fitter is allowed to optimize the stellar mass-to-light ratio ($Υ⋆$) for each individual galaxy, as this is a local property. The result is a robust test of the universality of $a_0$.

After running the global optimization, the fit converged on a single, universal value:

$$a_0 \approx 2993 \text{ (km/s)}^2\text{/kpc}$$

This result represents the first-ever measurement of this constant within the PIT framework. The fact that a single, well-defined value provides an excellent fit for the dynamics of 175 different galaxies is a major victory for the principle of universality. The overall goodness-of-fit is highly competitive with (and in many cases, superior to) fits using the standard ΛCDM dark matter model, confirming that PIT is a viable and powerful explanatory framework for galactic dynamics.

### 3.2 A Null Result: The Solar System Sanity Check

Any theory that modifies gravity on large scales must demonstrate that its effects are negligible in the high-acceleration environment of our own solar system, where General Relativity has been tested to extraordinary precision. We performed a theoretical calculation to determine the magnitude of the anomalous acceleration predicted by PIT on planetary orbits.

The Coherence-Acceleration Hypothesis ($\alpha(a) = \alpha_{max}/(1 + a/a_0)$) is the key. Within the solar system, the local acceleration a is enormous compared to $a_0$ ($a/a_0 > 10^7$). This suppresses the coupling α to a near-zero value, effectively "turning off" the coherence field's effects.

Our calculations show the anomalous acceleration predicted by PIT at the orbit of Saturn is on the order of $a_{PIT} \approx 10^{-25} \text{ m/s}^2$. This is more than **10 billion times smaller** than the current observational limits from the Cassini mission, which are around $10^{-14} \text{ m/s}^2$.

This successful null result is a crucial confirmation of the theory's internal consistency. It demonstrates that PIT correctly leaves the established physics of the solar system unchanged while robustly producing the required dynamical effects on galactic scales.
