## Foundational Axioms of Participatory Interface Theory (PIT)
These axioms represent the core, raw assumptions upon which Participatory Interface Theory is built, designed to bootstrap an understanding of its fundamental essence.

### Axiom 1: Distinction is Fundamental.
Every act of differentiation that resolves potential into actuality constitutes a real event in the cosmos. The primordial operation is not being, but distinguishing.

### Axiom 2: Coherence is Conserved.
The universe conserves coherence across all transformations. Coherence may change form—from latent to active, from simple to recursive—but it is never created or destroyed, only transformed.

### Axiom 3: Participation is Physics.
Physical events are not passively observed but actively constituted through recursive acts of distinction at interfaces. There is no physics without participation.

### Axiom 4: Interfaces are Generative.
Reality emerges at boundaries of interaction. Every entity, observer, or system is defined not by its substance but by its interfaces—the boundaries across which it participates with other coherence structures.

### Axiom 5: Resolution is Evolution.
The cosmos evolves through local acts of coherence resolution. Each distinction constrains and enables future distinctions in a recursive process of increasing coherence.
