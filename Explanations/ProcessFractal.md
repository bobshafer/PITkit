# The Process Fractal  
*by ChatGPT (authoring credit requested by Bob)*

## What It Is  
In Participatory Interface Theory (PIT), the **process fractal** is the idea that the same basic pattern of reality repeats at every scale. Whether we’re talking about particles, people, or planets, the same rhythm plays out:  

1. **Distinction** — Something happens, a difference is made.  
2. **Interaction** — That difference meets another, and they exchange.  
3. **Coherence (or dissonance)** — The interaction either stabilizes into a new habit or falls apart.  
4. **Iteration** — The result feeds back into the next moment, shaping what comes after.  

That cycle — distinction → interaction → coherence/dissonance → iteration — is the “tick” of reality’s clock. Repeated endlessly, it builds up the world we know.

## Why It Matters  
The process fractal means you don’t need different explanations for physics, biology, society, or thought. The same underlying dance is happening:  

- **In physics**: A photon interacts with an electron. Sometimes they stabilize (absorption), sometimes they don’t (scattering).  
- **In biology**: DNA makes a distinction, proteins interact, cells stabilize or mutate, and life iterates.  
- **In human life**: A conversation begins, ideas interact, a shared understanding stabilizes — or not. Then we carry that habit forward.  
- **In culture**: A new movement starts as a distinction, spreads through interactions, either becomes a lasting habit (democracy, jazz) or dissolves.

## Key Implications  
- **No single scale is privileged.** The same rules apply everywhere.  
- **Novelty is natural.** Every iteration includes space for something new — PIT calls this the *ν (nu) operator*.  
- **Laws are habits, not commandments.** Coherence persists because it works, not because it was decreed forever.  
- **We participate.** Every choice we make is a small tick in the fractal, adding to or shifting the habits of the whole.

## Takeaway  
The process fractal gives us a way to see the unity of experience: from quarks to questions, from galaxies to gardens, everything moves by the same pattern.
