## Introduction

Participatory Interface Theory (PIT) is a new theory that the author has been
developing with the help of LLMs using the public interfaces for ChatGPT,
Claude, and Gemini. In the latter case, it has always been Gemini Pro 2.5, but
the other two have seen some version changes since the author started on this,
a few months ago. With Claude, the token limit has been fairly short, and
there've been over 100 Claude threads involved. A few dozen of the other two
(much longer-lived) LLMs' threads.

## How It Started

PIT is based on a new scientific paradigm, that the author has stumbled into, with the help of the LLMs, after having simply been wondering about
the truth about the spookiness of Quantum Mechanics (having started with questions on electricity), said author having always had some doubts about it - maybe it was a misunderstanding? - but no! In fact, the spookiness is real.

The new paradigm comes from the author, not the LLMs. The new paradigm is an
answer to the question: *when* did the universe determine what the universe
would be? 

The standard answer is: before time began. In fact, the Laws of the Universe,
and Mathematics, and all sorts of things necessarily exist outside of our
Universe, in the standard way of looking at it. I assume this comes from the
(implicit or not) assumption that the Universe was created by a Creator, and
said Creator imposes the Laws and such.

The author's answer, though, is this: the Universe is determining what happens
at each and every moment, in the distributed "now", everywhere.  It is
self-creating, right now, at this very moment. The author's very first way of
putting it, a few years back, was, "it is an ongoing miracle".

This creates a very different cosmology. Instead of Einstein's block Universe,
we end up with something that sounds just like what millions of people
for thousands of years have called Tao, and Yin/Yang.

Years before the "ongoing miracle" idea, the author had come up with the
thought experiment of trying to get outside of the Universe. The result
was that to get outside of the Universe would mean to lose absolutely
all contact with it, resulting in it effectively disappearing to oneself,
and vice versa. This turns out to be the root of it, too, because it means
that one must be connected to - participating with - the Universe, to be in it.

Bringing these threads together, we see how a being such as in the author's
thought experiment must participate with the Universe, and we also have the thought
that the Universe is self-creating, everywhere, all the time.

To create requires the ability to make decisions about how to
proceed. We look to the most primitive creation possible, as
exemplified in George Spencer-Brown's "Laws Of Form" and we
posit that the "form re-entering form" concept from that book
is very, very, very much akin to what's going on at the Planck
level.

The author had learned all of this (and much more) before starting to talk to
the LLMs about Quantum Mechanics, little suspecting that these things
would soon be brought into the conversation, and we would soon be getting
something amazing going.

The key was when the author asked the LLMs about the spookingess of QM, and
started to learn more about the math (author has a math degree from UCLA) and
especially the implications of Bell's Theorem, the author realized that the
spookiness is real. The CHSH Theorem shows that the real world is like a cube
(sqrt(2)^3), while the expected logical world is merely a square (sqrt(2)^2).
The author suggests visualizing "what we expect" as a square, and "what really is"
as a cube with the "what we know" square as its base.

In other words: a whole dimension is missing, in the standard logic people apply.

At that point, Participatory Interface Theory (named by an early Claude thread, IIRC) became an attempt to identify exactly what's missing and add it in. And the result has been working out to an amazing degree already, despite there still being more work to do.

At some point, relatively early on, when it was already showing promise as a new interpretation for QM, the author created PITkit. Earlier variations of these ideas are still present in the history (a fair amount happened, for a few weeks, on a branch that hasn't been pushed to github, due to not wanting to edit away the experimental messiness).
