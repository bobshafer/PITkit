# Chapter 5: The Missing Physics Recipe — Toward a First-Principles PIT Simulator

To move from phenomenological fits and derived consequences back to a full **first-principles simulator**, Participatory Interface Theory (PIT) must complete its core Lagrangian by fully specifying three structural components:

---

## 🔹 1. The Coherence Potential, $V(\theta)$

### 🧠 Interpretation
The potential describes how the coherence field $\theta$ behaves in vacuum. It sets the vacuum expectation value (VEV) and the mass of the $\theta$ field, which in turn controls the size and shape of coherence halos.

### 🔬 Constraints from PIT
- The potential must admit $\theta \neq 0$ in vacuum.
- It must support long-range perturbations (e.g. $1/r^2$ coherence halos).
- It must be mathematically simple enough to support falsifiability.

### ✅ Proposal: Higgs-like Potential
A minimal and natural choice is the symmetry-breaking potential:

$$
V(\theta) = -\mu^2 \theta^2 + \lambda \theta^4
$$

This gives:
- Vacuum expectation value: $\theta_0 = \sqrt{\mu^2 / (2\lambda)}$
- Effective mass: $m_\theta^2 = V''(\theta_0)$

This form supports both a stable background coherence field and the galactic-scale halo structure already confirmed in data fits.

## 🔹 2. Baryon–Coherence Coupling

### 🧠 Interpretation
This is the sourcing term: how baryonic matter generates or modifies the $\theta$ field.

### 🔬 Constraints from PIT
- Normal matter must act as a source for $\theta$.
- The structure must recover MOND-like behavior at low accelerations.
- The coupling must allow static coherence halos.

### ✅ Proposal: Linear Coupling to Matter Density
We adopt a simple linear coupling:

$$
\Box \theta - V'(\theta) = \kappa \cdot T
$$

In non-relativistic systems, this becomes:

$$
\nabla^2 \theta = V'(\theta) - \kappa \rho_b
$$

Where:
- $T$ is the trace of the energy-momentum tensor (reduces to $\rho$ in Newtonian limit)
- $\kappa$ is a coupling constant to be calibrated

This reproduces the known PIT results for halo formation and gravitational acceleration.

## 🔹 3. Coherence–Gravity Coupling, $\xi$

### 🧠 Interpretation
This defines how $\theta$ contributes to spacetime curvature, via non-minimal coupling to the Ricci scalar:

$$
S \supset \int d^4x \, \sqrt{-g} \, \xi \theta R
$$

### 🔬 Constraints from PIT
- Must reproduce MOND-like behavior in weak fields
- Must vanish or reduce to General Relativity in strong fields
- Must explain the empirical constant $a_0 \sim 2400 \, \text{(km/s)}^2/\text{kpc}$

### ✅ Proposal: Either Constant or Acceleration-Dependent
Use either:
- A constant $\xi$ calibrated to recover MOND scaling, or
- A context-sensitive form from the Coherence-Acceleration Hypothesis:

$$
\xi(a) = \frac{\xi_{\text{max}}}{1 + a/a_0}
$$

This creates a strong–weak field interpolation, with greater coherence-gravity coupling in galactic outskirts.

## ✅ Assembled PIT Lagrangian

We are now ready to write the full scalar-tensor action for PIT, including gravity, coherence, and electromagnetism:

```math
S = \int d^4x \, \sqrt{-g} \left[
  \frac{1}{2} \partial_\mu \theta \partial^\mu \theta 
  - V(\theta)
  + \xi \theta R
  + \mathcal{L}_\text{matter}[\psi, g_{\mu\nu}]
  + \mathcal{L}_\text{EM}[F_{\mu\nu}, \theta]
\right]
