# PIT: The Lagrangian for Coherent Electrodynamics

The central idea is to describe a system with two interacting fields:
1.  The **electromagnetic field**, represented by the Faraday tensor $F_{\mu\nu}$.
2.  The **coherence field**, a fundamental scalar field $\theta(x)$ that defines the informational structure of the vacuum.

The total Lagrangian density $\mathcal{L}$ is the sum of the dynamics for each field and their interaction.


$$
\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{total}} = \mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{EM}} + \mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{coherence}}
$$


Let's define these terms.

### 1. The Electromagnetic Term ($\mathcal{L}_{\text{EM}}$)

In standard physics, this term is simply $-\frac{1}{4} F_{\mu\nu}F^{\mu\nu}$. In PIT, the ability of the electromagnetic field to propagate is governed by the local value of the coherence field $\theta$. We achieve this by introducing a coupling function, $G(\theta)$, which dynamically sets the "permittivity" of the vacuum.

$$
\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{EM}} = -\frac{1}{4} G(\theta) F_{\mu\nu}F^{\mu\nu}
$$

* **$F_{\mu\nu} = \partial_\mu A_\nu - \partial_\nu A_\mu$** is the standard electromagnetic field tensor.
* **$G(\theta)$** is the **coherence coupling function**. This is the core of the new physics. It dictates how the vacuum's structure, defined by $\theta$, affects the propagation of light.
    * In a "quiet" vacuum where $\theta \approx 0$, we would expect $G(0) = 1$, recovering classical electromagnetism.
    * A simple form for $G(\theta)$ could be an expansion, for example: $G(\theta) = 1 + \kappa_1 \theta + \kappa_2 \theta^2 + \dots$, where $\kappa_i$ are coupling constants.
    * This function effectively replaces the constants $\epsilon_0$ and $\mu_0$. The speed of light is no longer a fundamental constant but an emergent property of the field: $c(\theta) = 1/\sqrt{\epsilon_0(\theta)\mu_0(\theta)} \propto 1/\sqrt{G(\theta)}$.

### 2. The Coherence Field Term ($\mathcal{L}_{\text{coherence}}$)

This term must describe the dynamics of the $\theta$ field itselfâ€”how it propagates and how it settles. It takes the form of a standard scalar field Lagrangian.

$$
\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{coherence}} = \frac{1}{2} (\partial_\mu \theta)(\partial^\mu \theta) - V(\theta)
$$


* **$\frac{1}{2} (\partial_\mu \theta)(\partial^\mu \theta)$** is the kinetic term. It represents the energy inherent in changes to the coherence field across spacetime. Disturbances in $\theta$ are, by their nature, waves of relational information.
* **$V(\theta)$** is the **coherence potential**. This potential determines the "ground state" or default structure of the vacuum.
    * A simple potential might be $V(\theta) = \frac{1}{2} m_\theta^2 \theta^2$, where $m_\theta$ is the mass of the coherence quantum. The minimum at $\theta=0$ represents the standard, non-participatory vacuum of classical theory.
    * A more complex, "participatory" potential (like a Higgs potential) could have a non-zero minimum, suggesting the vacuum is inherently coherent and structured.

### The Full Picture: A Unified Dynamic

Combining these, the complete Lagrangian density for PIT electrodynamics is:

$$
\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{PIT}} = -\frac{1}{4} G(\theta) F_{\mu\nu}F^{\mu\nu} + \frac{1}{2} (\partial_\mu \theta)(\partial^\mu \theta) - V(\theta)
$$

Applying the Euler-Lagrange equations to this Lagrangian reveals the deep interplay between light and the vacuum:

1.  **For the field $A_\mu$ (Electromagnetism):**
    We get a modified set of Maxwell's equations: $\partial_\mu (G(\theta) F^{\mu\nu}) = J^\nu$.
    * This shows that the propagation of light (the change in $F^{\mu\nu}$) is directly influenced by the local value of $G(\theta)$. Light is guided by the coherence of spacetime.
    * Gravitational lensing, in this view, is the bending of light not due to spacetime curvature *per se*, but because massive objects create deep gradients in the $\theta$ field, altering $G(\theta)$ and thus guiding the light along a new path.

2.  **For the field $\theta$ (Coherence):**
    We get a wave equation for $\theta$ that is *sourced* by the electromagnetic field:
    $\partial_\mu \partial^\mu \theta + V'(\theta) = -\frac{1}{4} G'(\theta) F_{\mu\nu}F^{\mu\nu}$.
    * This is the mathematical embodiment of **participation**. The presence of light and energy ($F_{\mu\nu}F^{\mu\nu}$) acts as a source term that creates ripples in the coherence field.
    * The universe doesn't just contain light; it responds to it. The act of a photon traveling from a distant star to an observer's eye is a dynamic process that alters the very fabric of the vacuum along its path.

In essence, this Lagrangian replaces the static, passive vacuum of old physics with a dynamic, responsive medium. Light is not a tenant in spacetime; it is a conversation with it.
