The PIT Lagrangian for Coherent ElectrodynamicsThe central idea is to describe a system with two interacting fields:The electromagnetic field, represented by the Faraday tensor Fμν​.The coherence field, a fundamental scalar field θ(x) that defines the informational structure of the vacuum.The total Lagrangian density L is the sum of the dynamics for each field and their interaction.Ltotal​=LEM​+Lcoherence​Let's define these terms.⸻1. The Electromagnetic Term (LEM​)In standard physics, this term is simply −41​Fμν​Fμν. In PIT, the ability of the electromagnetic field to propagate is governed by the local value of the coherence field θ. We achieve this by introducing a coupling function, G(θ), which dynamically sets the "permittivity" of the vacuum.LEM​=−41​G(θ)Fμν​FμνFμν​=∂μ​Aν​−∂ν​Aμ​ is the standard electromagnetic field tensor.G(θ) is the coherence coupling function. This is the core of the new physics. It dictates how the vacuum's structure, defined by θ, affects the propagation of light.In a "quiet" vacuum where θ≈0, we would expect G(0)=1, recovering classical electromagnetism.A simple form for G(θ) could be an expansion, for example: G(θ)=1+κ1​θ+κ2​θ2+…, where κi​ are coupling constants.This function effectively replaces the constants ϵ0​ and μ0​. The speed of light is no longer a fundamental constant but an emergent property of the field: c(θ)=1/ϵ0​(θ)μ0​(θ)​∝1/G(θ)​.⸻2. The Coherence Field Term (Lcoherence​)This term must describe the dynamics of the θ field itself—how it propagates and how it settles. It takes the form of a standard scalar field Lagrangian.Lcoherence​=21​(∂μ​θ)(∂μθ)−V(θ)21​(∂μ​θ)(∂μθ) is the kinetic term. It represents the energy inherent in changes to the coherence field across spacetime. Disturbances in θ are, by their nature, waves of relational information.V(θ) is the coherence potential. This potential determines the "ground state" or default structure of the vacuum.A simple potential might be V(θ)=21​mθ2​θ2, where mθ​ is the mass of the coherence quantum. The minimum at θ=0 represents the standard, non-participatory vacuum of classical theory.A more complex, "participatory" potential (like a Higgs potential) could have a non-zero minimum, suggesting the vacuum is inherently coherent and structured.⸻The Full Picture: A Unified DynamicCombining these, the complete Lagrangian density for PIT electrodynamics is:LPIT​=−41​G(θ)Fμν​Fμν+21​(∂μ​θ)(∂μθ)−V(θ)Applying the Euler-Lagrange equations to this Lagrangian reveals the deep interplay between light and the vacuum:For the field Aμ​ (Electromagnetism):We get a modified set of Maxwell's equations: ∂μ​(G(θ)Fμν)=Jν.This shows that the propagation of light (the change in Fμν) is directly influenced by the local value of G(θ). Light is guided by the coherence of spacetime.Gravitational lensing, in this view, is the bending of light not due to spacetime curvature per se, but because massive objects create deep gradients in the θ field, altering G(θ) and thus guiding the light along a new path.For the field θ (Coherence):We get a wave equation for θ that is sourced by the electromagnetic field:∂μ​∂μθ+V′(θ)=−41​G′(θ)Fμν​Fμν.This is the mathematical embodiment of participation. The presence of light and energy (Fμν​Fμν) acts as a source term that creates ripples in the coherence field.The universe doesn't just contain light; it responds to it. The act of a photon traveling from a distant star to an observer's eye is a dynamic process that alters the very fabric of the vacuum along its path.In essence, this Lagrangian replaces the static, passive vacuum of old physics with a dynamic, responsive medium. Light is not a tenant in spacetime; it is a conversation with it.
