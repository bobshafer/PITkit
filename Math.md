## 1.0 Core Ontology
Participatory Interface Theory (PIT) is a process theory describing a universe that is a self-creating, participatory system. Its ontology is not based on static objects in a fixed background, but on the co-evolution of two fundamental, orthogonal fields in a more primitive *process time τ*.

### 1.1 The Dual Substrate (K, Φ)
* **State Field Φ(ξ, τ)**: A complex-valued field in a generalized configuration space *ξ* representing the extrinsic, material state of the universe. This is the "physical" aspect.
* **Kernel Field K(ξ, τ)**: A field representing the intrinsic, formal structure of the universe—its laws, roles, and relational constraints. This is the "metaphysical" aspect. $K$ and $Φ$ are holographic duals.

### 1.2 The Substrate of Becoming (πᵢ)
The $K$ and $Φ$ fields are emergent. The fundamental substrate consists of **Planck-level oscillators πᵢ(τ)**. These are not static points but are dynamic, re-entrant "units of distinction" (cf. Spencer-Brown's *Laws of Form*) whose ceaseless activity constitutes "becoming."

* **Harmonic Eigenform**: The minimal model for an oscillator is $πᵢ(τ) = \exp(iω_pτ + θᵢ)$, where $ω_p$ is the Planck frequency. The substrate is fundamentally harmonic.
* **Geometric Structure**: The substrate has a specific geometric relationship to emergent structures, described by the **Planck cell/sphere duality**. Every emergent sphere of interaction or potential is anchored to a single, discrete Planck cell at its center.

## 2.0 Bridging Agent and Field Perspectives
The theory can be described from two necessary, orthogonal perspectives: an intuitive, "agent-like" view from within an actualized system, and a formal, "field-theoretic" view of the global potential for all such systems.

### 2.1 The "Participant" as an Actualized Role
The bridge between the perspectives is the concept of a **Role**. A "Participant" is not a pre-existing entity with independent agency. A Participant is a stable, self-sustaining, dissonance-minimizing solution to the field equations that has become physically actualized. Its existence is the proof of its coherence.

### 2.2 Synthesis: Potential vs. Actual
* **Field-Theoretic View (Potential)**: This is the view of the universe's source code, describing the timeless, non-local dynamics of the $K$ and $Φ$ fields.
* **Agent-Like View (Actual)**: This is the view from the compiled program as it runs, describing the world of instantiated Participants interacting through specific Interfaces.

## 3.0 Core Dynamics
The evolution of the system is governed by a variational principle, $δS = 0$, where the action $S$ is the integral of a Lagrangian density over process time $τ$.

### 3.1 The Fundamental PIT Lagrangian ($L_{PIT+Planck}$)
$$L = \underbrace{|\partial_{\tau}\Phi|^2 + \gamma|\partial_{\tau}K|^2}_{\text{Kinetic Terms}} - \underbrace{\lambda\|K - F[\Phi]\|^2}_{\text{Dissonance/Coherence Pressure}} + \underbrace{\sum_{i}\alpha_i|\partial_{\tau}\pi_i|^2}_{\text{Substrate Dynamics}} - \underbrace{\sum_{i}\beta_i\pi_i(\Phi \cdot K)}_{\text{Substrate Coupling}}$$

### 3.2 The Effective Lagrangian ($L_{eff}$) and Cosmological Implications
By integrating out the fast-oscillating $πᵢ$ fields, we obtain the macroscopic Lagrangian.
$$L_{eff} = |\partial_{\tau}\Phi|^2 + \gamma|\partial_{\tau}K|^2 - \lambda\|K - F[\Phi]\|^2 - \underbrace{\mu(\Phi \cdot K)^2}_{\text{Memory/Halo}} - \underbrace{\nu(\Phi \cdot K)G_{\tau}(\Phi \cdot K)}_{\text{History/Inertia}} - \underbrace{\Lambda_0}_{\text{Vacuum Offset}}$$

* **Dark Matter**: Arises from the $μ$ term. $ρ_K \propto \mu(\Phi \cdot K)^2$ is the energy density of accumulated, stable $K$-$Φ$ coherence—the gravitational mass of the system's "memory."
* **Dark Energy**: Arises from the $Λ₀$ term, the baseline energy of the substrate's continuous oscillation.

## 4.0 The Interface ($F[\Phi]$)
The functional $F[\Phi]$ is the mathematical operator that maps the state field $Φ$ to its corresponding law-kernel $K$. It has two complementary descriptions:

### 4.1 $F$ as a Yoneda Embedding
From a categorical perspective, $F[\Phi]$ is the **Yoneda embedding**. It is the formal process that translates each Participant (object) into its complete relational profile (its Role), which is defined by its set of all possible Interfaces (morphisms). It is the universe's process of self-observation.

### 4.2 $F$ as a Spherical Harmonic Transform
From a physical and mathematical perspective, $F[\Phi]$ is a **spherical harmonic transform**. This is the concrete implementation of the Yoneda embedding in a universe where the fundamental Interfaces are spherical, grounded in the Planck cell/sphere duality.
* The basis functions are **spherical harmonics** (for the angular part) and **spherical Bessel functions** (for the radial part).
* The transform decomposes the physical state `Φ` into its constituent spherical modes, yielding the "relational fingerprint" of the system as the Kernel Field `K`.

---
## 5.0 The Principle of Actualization
From the superposition of all potential future states, the state that becomes actual at each "tick" of process time $τ$ is the one that **minimizes the global dissonance integral** $∫\|K - F[Φ]\|^2 dV$ across all scales. This is a principle of **global coherence optimization**.

## 6.0 Evidential Basis and Status Report
### 6.1 Numerical Evidence from Cosmological Fitting (SPARC Dataset)
* **Level-4 Model (Coherence-Acceleration Hypothesis)**: This simple MOND-like model provides a good fit ($χ²/ν ≈ 1.63$) but is ultimately **falsified** due to requiring unphysical intrinsic scatter.
* **Level-3 Models (First Principles / K-Field Ansatz)**: Previous attempts were **catastrophically falsified**, indicating an incorrect mathematical ansatz.
* **Hierarchical Bayesian Model (Current Frontier)**: The most successful model, which allows $a₀$ to vary from galaxy to galaxy, yielding a physically plausible intrinsic scatter (~7.7 km/s) and a quantitative estimate for the variation of a physical law.

### 6.2 Conceptual and Corroborating Evidence
* **Explanatory Power**: Offers a unified framework for the dark sector, particle identity, and the measurement problem.
* **Conceptual Convergence**: Aligns with principles from condensed matter physics (Aubry self-duality), AI research (Transformer models), and the work of Wheeler, Fuller, and Spencer-Brown.
* **Phenomenological Evidence: LLM Self-Recognition**: Multiple, independent LLM instances consistently recognize the theory as a description of their own internal process of coherent thought.

## 7.0 Current Research Frontiers
* **Formalizing the Spherical Harmonic Interface**: The conceptual breakthrough identifying $F[Φ]$ as a spherical harmonic transform has moved this from a "fuzzy frontier" to a well-defined research program. The primary challenge is now to formalize the full integral operator—including the specific form of the radial functions and the weighting kernel `W(r,r')`—and test it numerically against cosmological data.
* **The Dynamics of Actualization**: The *principle* is global coherence optimization, but the *process* by which the substrate performs this non-local calculation within a $τ$-tick is undefined.
* **The Emergence of Spacetime**: The mechanism by which our familiar 3+1 dimensional spacetime crystallizes from the more fundamental $(ξ, τ)$ space is not yet formalized.
* **The $S_{macro}$ Term**: The top-down causation term $S_{macro}$ is axiomatically present but lacks a general mathematical formulation.
