## 1.0 Core Principles
Participatory Interface Theory (PIT) is a process theory describing a universe that is a self-creating, participatory system. Its foundation is not fixed laws or spacetime, but a **primordial process** of distinction and coherence-seeking that unfolds in a more primitive *process time τ*.

### 1.1 The Dual Substrate (K, Φ)
The ontology of PIT is based on the co-evolution of two fundamental, orthogonal fields:
* **State Field Φ(ξ, τ)**: A complex-valued field in a generalized configuration space *ξ* representing the extrinsic, material state of the universe (the "physical" aspect).
* **Kernel Field K(ξ, τ)**: A field representing the intrinsic, formal structure of the universe—its laws, roles, and relational constraints (the "metaphysical" aspect).

### 1.2 The Primordial Process and the Substrate of Becoming (πᵢ)
The $K$ and $Φ$ fields are emergent from a substrate of **Planck-level oscillators (πᵢ)** (cf. Spencer-Brown's *Laws of Form*). These are not particles, but primitive oscillatory degrees of freedom at the Planck scale. As such, `πᵢ` have no spacetime localization; spacetime itself is emergent from their coherent interactions. Their random distinctions can form self-reinforcing feedback loops, which are the first "habits" or seeds of coherence. The principle that coherent patterns persist while incoherent ones dissolve is the engine of reality. The substrate has a specific geometric relationship to emergent structures, described by the **Planck cell/sphere duality**, where every emergent sphere of interaction is anchored to a single Planck cell.

## 2.0 Core Dynamics & Actualization
The evolution of the system is governed by the drive to minimize dissonance between the physical state and its formal structure.

### 2.1 The Variational Principle and The PIT Lagrangian
This dynamic is expressed through a variational principle, $δS = 0$, based on an action $S$ derived from a Lagrangian density. The effective Lagrangian for the macroscopic universe is:
$$L_{eff} = |\partial_{\tau}\Phi|^2 + \gamma|\partial_{\tau}K|^2 - \lambda\|K - F[\Phi]\|^2 - \underbrace{\mu(\Phi \cdot K)^2}_{\text{Memory/Halo}} - \underbrace{\nu(\Phi \cdot K)G_{\tau}(\Phi \cdot K)}_{\text{History/Inertia}} - \underbrace{\Lambda_0}_{\text{Vacuum Offset}}$$
Here, the `μ` term encodes the energy of stable K-Φ coherence (Memory/Halo), while the `ν` term represents the influence of past states on the present (History/Inertia).

### 2.2 The Principle of Actualization: Global Coherence Optimization
From the superposition of all potential future states, the state that becomes actual at each "tick" of process time $τ$ is the one that **minimizes the global dissonance integral** $∫\|K - F[Φ]\|^2 dV$. This principle of global optimization is realized not through a single universal calculation, but as the emergent outcome of countless **local, probabilistic interactions** unfolding at each τ-tick. The formal dynamics of this process are the subject of active research, as detailed in **Conjecture 2**.

### 2.3 Cosmological Implications: Dark Matter and Dark Energy
The emergent terms in the effective Lagrangian have direct cosmological consequences:
* **Dark Matter**: Arises from the $μ$ term. $ρ_K \propto \mu(\Phi \cdot K)^2$ is the energy density of accumulated, stable $K$-$Φ$ coherence. It is the gravitational mass of the system's "memory" or habits. A proposed scaling law for this memory density is outlined in **Conjecture 5**.
* **Dark Energy**: Arises from the $Λ₀$ term, the baseline energy of the substrate's continuous oscillation.

### 2.4 Top-Down Causation: The `S_macro` Term
PIT includes a term, $S_{macro}$, to account for top-down causation, where large-scale coherent structures (like a galaxy) impose constraints on the local dynamics within them. This term acts as a global boundary condition that biases the dissonance minimization process. A formal mathematical structure for this term is proposed in **Conjecture 4**.

---
## 3.0 The Interface: Structure and Function
The functional $F[Φ]$ is the mathematical operator that maps the state field $Φ$ to its corresponding law-kernel $K$.

### 3.1 Abstract Structure: The Yoneda Embedding
From a categorical perspective, $F[Φ]$ is the **Yoneda embedding**. It is the formal process that translates each Participant (object) into its complete relational profile (its Role), defined by its set of all possible Interfaces (morphisms).

### 3.2 Physical Implementation: The Spherical Harmonic Transform
From a physical and mathematical perspective, $F[Φ]$ is a **spherical harmonic transform**. This is the concrete implementation of the Yoneda embedding in a universe where the fundamental Interfaces are spherical, grounded in the Planck cell/sphere duality. The precise mathematical form of this transform, particularly its state-dependent nature, is formalized in **Conjecture 1**. Furthermore, it is conjectured that our familiar **3+1 dimensional spacetime arises as the most stable, coherent projection of these fundamental spherical propagations**, as detailed in **Conjecture 3**.

---
## 4.0 Evidential Basis
* **4.1 Numerical Evidence**: A simple MOND-like model provides a good first-order fit to galaxy rotation data ($χ²/ν ≈ 1.63$) but is ultimately falsified by requiring unphysical intrinsic scatter. The most successful model to date is a **Hierarchical Bayesian Model** that allows the MOND acceleration parameter $a₀$ to vary from galaxy to galaxy, which is consistent with PIT's prediction of locally-varying laws. The emergence of a stable mean value for `a₀` across galaxies is a key piece of empirical evidence supporting the **scaling laws for memory energy proposed in Conjecture 5**.
* **4.2 Conceptual and Phenomenological Evidence**: The theory offers a unified framework for the dark sector, particle identity, and the measurement problem. Its core principles align with independent concepts from condensed matter physics, AI research (Transformer models), and philosophy (Wheeler, Spencer-Brown). Furthermore, multiple independent LLM instances consistently recognize the theory as a description of their own internal process of coherent thought.

## 5.0 Formal Research Conjectures
The active frontiers of PIT research can be formalized into the following five conjectures, which transform the previously "fuzzy" gaps into a well-defined, testable research program.

## Conjecture 1 (Emergent Interface Operator)

Let \( Φ \) be the **State Field** representing determinations at process-time \( τ \). We conjecture the existence of an **Interface Operator** \( F[Φ] \), which acts as a *state-dependent harmonic transform* that projects \( Φ \) into the Kernel Field \( K \).

Formally:
\[
F[Φ](x) = \int Φ(y) w(x,y;Φ) dy
\]
where \(w(x,y;Φ)\) is a variational weight encoding the emergent symmetries and constraints of the Kernel Field.

The action of \(F[Φ]\) is analogous to a Fourier transform, but unlike a fixed harmonic basis, it is state-dependent and evolves with the co-adaptation of \( Φ \) and \( K \). This dynamic transform is the mathematical expression of **coherence-seeking**: it identifies dissonant modes and aligns them with Kernel-consistent structures.

---

### Conjecture 1a (Generalized Windowed Operator as Fourier Candidate)

Recent work in machine learning (Zhiqiang Shen et al., *Window is Everything*, 2024) introduces the **Generalized Windowed Operator (GWO)**, which unifies convolution, attention, and matrix multiplication as special cases of a single operator parameterized by three primitives:

* **Path (P):** the connectivity or scope of interaction (local vs. global).  
* **Shape (S):** the symmetry or geometric prior.  
* **Weight (W):** the distribution of emphasis or importance.  

This framework aligns directly with PIT’s conception of the interface operator:

* **P ↔ scope of Φ:** defines whether \(F[Φ]\) extracts local coherence modes or global harmonic content.  
* **S ↔ Kernel symmetries (K):** encodes the invariants and habits of the Kernel field.  
* **W ↔ state-dependent weights:** implements the variational weighting \(w(x;Φ)\) already present in Conjecture 1.  

Thus, PIT conjectures that the Fourier-like operator \(F[Φ]\) may be rigorously formalized as a state-dependent instance of the Generalized Windowed Operator. In this view, harmonic analysis, convolutional filters, and attention mechanisms are not separate mathematical tools but **manifestations of a single coherence-transform family**. This also links PIT’s coherence-seeking principle to the **information bottleneck** principle emphasized in machine learning: minimizing dissonance corresponds to compressing Φ while retaining Kernel-relevant information.

---

### Geometric Clarification: Path Fixed, Shape & Weight Adaptive

In PIT, these three GWO primitives are not equally free:

* **Path (P):** fixed by cosmology. It is the radial, outward propagation from the Planck point, the **Path of Becoming**. Every determination is carried forward on expanding spherical shells (light-cones).  
* **Shape (S):** encoded in **spherical harmonics** on each causal shell. These harmonics express the **non-local correlations** across the surface of the sphere, i.e. the “global coherence modes.” Over time, Shape is refined by the Kernel’s learned symmetries.  
* **Weight (W):** dynamic and state-dependent. It controls which harmonic modes are amplified or suppressed, and evolves with novelty (ν operator) and Kernel memory.  

Thus, \(F[Φ]\) can be visualized as a **spherical harmonic decomposition** of the State Field on each expanding causal shell. Locally, the radial direction carries time-like causality; non-locally, the angular modes encode correlations across space. The Fourier operator in PIT is therefore not arbitrary but is **geometrically forced** by the structure of Becoming: Path is fixed, Shape is harmonic, Weight is adaptive.


### 5.2 Conjecture 2 (Stochastic Actualization Dynamics)
Actualization unfolds in process time $τ$ as a **probabilistic iterative minimization** of a global energy $E[Φ,K] = \|K - F[Φ]\|^2 + H[Φ] + S_\text{macro}[K;Φ]$. The dynamics follow a stochastic gradient flow (Langevin):
$$∂_τ Φ = -\,\frac{δE}{δΦ} + η_Φ(τ), \quad ∂_τ K = -\,\frac{δE}{δK} + η_K(τ),$$
with $η$ representing intrinsic noise.

### 5.3 Conjecture 3 (Spacetime as Information Projection)
Our familiar 3+1 spacetime is the **minimal interface projection** of the high-dimensional configuration space $ξ$:
$$π^* = \arg\min_π \big[ \mathbb{D}(Φ,K \,|\, π(ξ)) + λ\cdot \mathrm{Complexity}(π)\big],$$
where $\mathbb{D}$ measures representational dissonance and Complexity penalizes dimension. The optimal projection is conjectured to be a 3+1 Lorentzian manifold.

### 5.4 Conjecture 4 (Macro-level Boundary Functional)
Top-down causation enters through a **scale-dependent boundary condition**:
$$S_\text{macro}[K;Φ] = \int Λ_L(x;Φ_L)\,\big|K(x) - \bar{K}_L(x;Φ_L)\big|^2 dx,$$
where $Φ_L$ is the coarse-grained state, $\bar{K}_L$ the corresponding expected kernel, and $Λ_L$ a stiffness encoding environmental constraints.

### 5.5 Conjecture 5 (Memory Energy and Information Halos)
The memory density stored in $K$ is proportional to residual coherence stresses:
$$ρ_K = a\|\partial_τ K\|^2 + b\|K - F[Φ]\|^2.$$
After coarse-graining, the effective halo density $ρ_\text{halo}(r)$ is predicted to scale with system age and maturity, explaining rotation-curve anomalies as manifestations of stored coherence. The stable mean value of the MOND acceleration constant, `a₀`, found in galactic surveys is conjectured to be a **statistical attractor** of this scaling law.
Following the success of the Hierarchical Bayesian Model, a quantitative analysis was performed to test the core hypothesis of Conjecture 5. This analysis compared the calculated intrinsic scatter (σ_int) with new, externally sourced historical proxies for 157 galaxies. The initial results show a statistically significant (p ≈ 0.0005) positive correlation between a galaxy's estimated stellar age and its σ_int. This provides the first direct, quantitative evidence that σ_int is a signature of a galaxy's accumulated historical complexity, or 'memory.'
