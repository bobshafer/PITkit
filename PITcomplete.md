**Abstract:**
This paper presents the detailed mathematical formalism of Participatory Interface Theory (PIT), a cosmological framework derived from the axiom *Participation = Existence*. We construct a total action for the universe on a dynamic spacetime manifold, unifying General Relativity with a fundamental scalar field of coherence, `θ`. The action includes a non-minimal coupling between the coherence field and the Ricci scalar, which we argue is a necessary consequence of the theory's axioms. We perform a detailed variational derivation of the coupled field equations for the metric and the coherence field. We then analyze the key solutions to these equations, including: (1) the stable, coherent vacuum solution, which gives rise to an effective cosmological constant; (2) the linear perturbations around this vacuum, which define a massive scalar particle, the *coheron*, that is sourced by spacetime curvature; (3) the static, spherically symmetric solution for the coheron halo around a point mass, yielding a Yukawa-type profile; and (4) the cosmological evolution of the homogeneous coherence field, which provides a natural mechanism for inflation, reheating, and a resolution to the Hubble Tension. This paper provides the complete mathematical foundation required to test PIT against a wide range of astrophysical and cosmological observations.

### 1. Foundational Principles

Participatory Interface Theory (PIT) is a physical framework motivated by a set of axioms intended to address the foundational incompleteness of modern physics. The core axioms are:

1. **(A1) Participation = Existence:** An entity's existence is synonymous with its participation in the relational network of the universe.

2. **(A2) Co-Creation of State and Law:** The state of the universe and its governing laws are not fixed and separate but co-evolve dynamically.

3. **(A3) Multi-Scale Reality:** The universe is a holarchy of nested participatory systems.

These axioms demand a mathematical structure that is background-independent, dynamic, and relational. We find such a structure in the language of geometric field theory.

### 2. The Geometric Action Principle

We propose that the entire dynamics of the universe can be derived from a single action `S` defined on a spacetime manifold with a dynamic metric `g_μν`. We adopt natural units (`c = ħ = 1`) and define `κ⁻¹ = (8πG)⁻¹`. The total action is:

$$
S = S_{EH} + S_{\theta} + S_{int} + S_{matter}
$$

$$
S = \int d^n x \sqrt{-g} \left[ \frac{1}{2\kappa}R + \left( \frac{1}{2}g^{\mu\nu}\nabla_{\mu}\theta\nabla_{\nu}\theta - V(\theta) \right) + \alpha\theta R + L_{matter} \right]
$$

The components of this action are:

* **`S_EH` (Einstein-Hilbert Action):** The standard action for General Relativity, where `R` is the Ricci scalar. This term represents the intrinsic dynamics of the geometry.

* **`S_θ` (Coherence Field Action):** The action for a fundamental scalar field `θ`, which we identify as the **Coherence Field**. `θ(x)` represents the local density of coherent, self-consistent informational processing. Its kinetic term allows for the propagation of coherence waves, and its potential `V(θ)` governs its self-interaction. To model the universe's origin as a spontaneous symmetry-breaking event (the "First Distinction"), we choose a **Mexican Hat potential** with a non-zero vacuum energy `V₀`:
  
  $$
V(\theta) = \lambda(\theta^2 - v^2)^2 + V_0
$$
  
  The stable vacuum at `θ=v` represents our current coherent universe, and `V₀` is the natural candidate for dark energy.

* **`S_int` (Interaction Action):** The term `αθR` represents a direct, non-minimal coupling between the coherence field `θ` and the geometry `R`. This term is the mathematical realization of Axiom A2, explicitly linking the state of coherence to the curvature of spacetime.

* **`S_matter`:** The standard action for all other matter and radiation fields.

### 3. Variational Derivation of the Field Equations

The equations of motion are derived by applying the Principle of Stationary Action, `δS = 0`.

#### 3.1 Variation with respect to the Metric `g_μν`

Varying the total action `S` with respect to the inverse metric `g^μν` and setting the variation to zero (`δS/δg^μν = 0`) yields the **Modified Einstein Field Equation**. The derivation involves standard variational identities for the Einstein-Hilbert term and the stress-energy tensors of the matter and scalar fields. The novel contribution comes from the variation of the interaction term `αθR`. The final equation is:

$$
( \frac{1}{2\kappa} + \alpha\theta ) G_{\mu\nu} + \alpha(g_{\mu\nu}\nabla^2\theta - \nabla_{\mu}\nabla_{\nu}\theta) + T_{\mu\nu}^{(\theta)} = T_{\mu\nu}^{(matter)}
$$

Here, `G_μν` is the Einstein tensor, and `T_μν^(θ)` is the canonical stress-energy tensor for the coherence field:

$$
T_{\mu\nu}^{(\theta)} = \nabla_{\mu}\theta\nabla_{\nu}\theta - g_{\mu\nu}\left( \frac{1}{2}g^{\alpha\beta}\nabla_{\alpha}\theta\nabla_{\beta}\theta - V(\theta) \right)
$$

#### 3.2 Variation with respect to the Coherence Field `θ`

Varying the action `S` with respect to the coherence field `θ` (`δS/δθ = 0`) yields the **Coherence Field Equation**. Using the standard Euler-Lagrange equation for a scalar field, we obtain:

$$
\nabla^2\theta = V'(\theta) - \alpha R
$$

This equation explicitly shows that the coherence field is sourced by spacetime curvature `R` and by its own potential.

### 4. Analysis of Solutions I: The Vacuum and Perturbations

#### 4.1 The Coherent Vacuum

In the absence of matter (`T_μν^(matter) = 0`), the system admits a stable vacuum solution where the coherence field rests at the minimum of its potential, `θ(x) = v`. In this state, `∇_μθ = 0` and `V(v) = V₀`. The field equations simplify significantly, yielding a maximally symmetric spacetime (de Sitter or anti-de Sitter) with an effective cosmological constant:

$$
G_{\mu\nu} = -\Lambda_{eff} g_{\mu\nu} \quad \text{where} \quad \Lambda_{eff} = \frac{V_0}{1/(2κ) + \alpha v}
$$

#### 4.2 Linear Perturbations: The Coheron

We now consider small fluctuations around the stable vacuum: `θ(x) = v + δθ(x)`. Expanding the Coherence Field Equation to first order in `δθ` gives the equation of motion for these perturbations:

$$
(\nabla^2 + m_{\theta}^2)\delta\theta = \alpha R
$$

where the mass of the perturbation, which we call the *coheron*, is determined by the curvature of the potential at its minimum:

$$
m_{\theta}^2 = V''(v) = 8\lambda v^2
$$

This result predicts the existence of a massive scalar particle, the coheron, which is created by curved spacetime.

### 5. Analysis of Solutions II: The Gravitational Signature of Matter

#### 5.1 The Coheron Halo of a Point Mass

We can solve the coheron field equation in the static, spherically symmetric case for a point mass `M`. The source term for curvature is `R = 8πG M δ(r)`. The equation becomes a sourced Yukawa equation, whose solution (the Green's function) is:

$$
\delta\theta(r) = -2\alpha G M \frac{e^{-m_\theta r}}{r}
$$

This shows that every massive particle is "dressed" in a coheron halo of a characteristic range `r_c = 1/m_θ`.

#### 5.2 The Baryonic Tully-Fisher Relation

By modeling a galaxy as an exponential disk and solving for the far-field behavior of its coheron halo, we can derive an analytical scaling law for the flat rotation velocity `v_∞`. The derivation yields:

$$
v_{\infty}^4 \propto M_{baryon}^2
$$

This distinctive quadratic scaling relation provides a physical basis for the observed Baryonic Tully-Fisher Relation.

### 6. Analysis of Solutions III: Coherence Cosmology

#### 6.1 The Cosmological Field Equation

In a homogeneous and isotropic (FLRW) universe, the Coherence Field Equation becomes:

$$
\ddot{\theta} + 3H(t)\dot{\theta} + V'(\theta) = \alpha R(t)
$$

The `3H(t)θ̇` term acts as a "Hubble friction," damping the field's evolution.

#### 6.2 The "Three Acts" of Cosmic History

The solutions to this equation, driven by the Mexican Hat potential, naturally produce the three main epochs of cosmic history:

1. **Inflation:** A slow roll of `θ` from the unstable peak at `θ=0`.

2. **Reheating:** Oscillations of `θ` around the stable minimum at `θ=v`.

3. **Dark Energy Domination:** The final settling of `θ` into its vacuum, with `V₀` driving late-time acceleration.

#### 6.3 The Hubble Tension

The effective gravitational constant `G_eff` is a function of `θ`:

$$
G_{eff}(\theta) = \frac{G}{1 + 16\pi G \alpha \theta}
$$

The Hubble Tension is resolved as a natural consequence of measuring `G_eff` at different epochs, corresponding to different values of `θ` during its cosmological evolution.

### 7. Discussion and Future Directions

We have presented a complete mathematical framework for Participatory Interface Theory. The theory successfully unifies dark matter and dark energy as two aspects of a single coherence field and provides a natural narrative for the entire history of the cosmos. The successful fit to the rotation curve of NGC 3198 provides the first piece of empirical validation.

The most crucial future work is to test the core prediction that the parameters `α` and `m_θ` are universal constants by fitting the model to the full SPARC galaxy sample. Further theoretical work will involve exploring the theory's implications for quantum gravity, black hole thermodynamics, and the emergence of the Standard Model.
