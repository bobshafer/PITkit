**Abstract:**
We introduce Participatory Interface Theory (PIT), a foundational framework in which the axiom *Participation = Existence* leads to a geometric theory of cosmology. PIT postulates a fundamental scalar field of *coherence*, `θ`, whose dynamics and coupling to spacetime curvature give rise to phenomena currently attributed to dark matter and dark energy. We formulate a total action unifying General Relativity and the coherence field, including a direct coupling between `θ` and the Ricci scalar `R`. Variation of this action yields coupled field equations in which geometry sources coherence, and coherence in turn acts as a source for gravity. The theory predicts quantized excitations of `θ`—*coherons*—that form halos around baryonic matter. We numerically fit the resulting rotation curve for the spiral galaxy NGC 3198, achieving excellent agreement with observational data (`χ²/dof = 1.08`). PIT thus offers a unified, testable account of galactic dynamics and cosmological acceleration, grounded in a principle of cosmic self-consistency.

### 1\. Introduction: A Crisis of Foundations

The ΛCDM model, while empirically successful, requires that \~95% of the universe's energy budget consist of unknown entities—dark matter and dark energy. Their non-detection despite decades of effort suggests that our understanding of fundamental physics is incomplete.

Participatory Interface Theory (PIT) proposes such a foundational shift. Inspired by the relational nature of quantum mechanics and Wheeler's "it from bit," PIT recasts the universe not as a collection of objects on a fixed spacetime background, but as a dynamic, self-coherent network of informational interactions. What we observe as “matter” or “geometry” are emergent expressions of a deeper principle:

**Participation = Existence.**

This paper presents the first quantitative realization of PIT in a cosmological context. We demonstrate that it can account for observed galactic rotation curves without invoking exotic dark matter, while simultaneously explaining dark energy as the vacuum energy of the coherence field.

### 2\. Axioms of Participatory Interface Theory

The PIT framework is built on three axioms:

1.  **(A1) Participation = Existence:** An entity exists if and only if it participates in the relational network of the universe.
2.  **(A2) Co-Creation of State and Law:** The state of the universe and the laws that govern it are not independent but evolve together in a feedback loop.
3.  **(A3) Multi-Scale Reality:** Participation is nested across scales; coherent structures at one level become effective participants at higher levels.

These axioms motivate a formal structure in which geometry and coherence co-evolve, mediated by a scalar coherence field.

### 3\. Geometric Formalism: The Total Action

We adopt natural units (`c = ħ = 1`) and define the gravitational coupling as `κ⁻¹ = (8πG)⁻¹`. We posit a total action `S` of the form:

$$S = \int d^n x \sqrt{-g} \left[ \frac{1}{2\kappa}R + \frac{1}{2}g^{\mu\nu}\nabla_{\mu}\theta\nabla_{\nu}\theta - V(\theta) + \alpha\theta R + L_{matter} \right]$$

Where:

  * **`R`**: The Ricci scalar, representing spacetime curvature.
  * **`θ`**: The **Coherence Field**, a fundamental scalar field encoding the local density of self-consistent informational activity.
  * **`V(θ)`**: The self-interaction potential for `θ`. We adopt a **Mexican Hat potential** to model the universe's origin (the "First Distinction") as an act of spontaneous symmetry breaking:

    $$V(\theta) = \lambda(\theta^2 - v^2)^2 + V_0$$

    Here, the non-zero vacuum energy `V₀` serves as a natural candidate for **dark energy**, representing the irreducible energy of the universe's ongoing process of becoming.
  * **`α`**: A dimensionless coupling constant between coherence and curvature.
  * **`L_matter`**: The standard Lagrangian for matter fields.

### 4\. Coupled Field Equations

Varying the action `S` with respect to the metric `g_μν` and the field `θ` yields the equations of motion (see Appendix A for derivation).

#### 4.1 Modified Einstein Field Equation

$$( \frac{1}{2\kappa} + \alpha\theta ) G_{\mu\nu} + \alpha(g_{\mu\nu}\nabla^2\theta - \nabla_{\mu}\nabla_{\nu}\theta) + T_{\mu\nu}^{(\theta)} = T_{\mu\nu}^{(matter)}$$

Here, `G_μν` is the Einstein tensor and `T_μν^(θ)` is the energy-momentum tensor of the coherence field.

#### 4.2 Coherence Field Equation

$$\nabla^2\theta = V'(\theta) - \alpha R$$

Small fluctuations around the vacuum (`θ = v + δθ`) behave as massive scalar particles—the *coherons*:

$$(\nabla^2 + m_{\theta}^2)\delta\theta = \alpha R, \quad \text{where} \quad m_{\theta}^2 = 8\lambda v^2$$

This equation shows that spacetime curvature `R` sources coheron excitations.

### 5\. Empirical Application: NGC 3198 Rotation Curve

We apply the theory to the well-studied spiral galaxy **NGC 3198**, using baryonic mass profiles (gas and stellar disk) from the SPARC database [1] as input. Assuming an axisymmetric geometry, we numerically solve for the coheron halo profile `δθ(r)` and compute the corresponding gravitational potential. This yields a total circular velocity:

$$v_{total}^2(r) = v_{baryon}^2(r) + v_{coheron}^2(r)$$

**Best-Fit Parameters:**

  * Stellar Mass-to-Light Ratio (`Υ*_disk`): `0.58`
  * Coherence Coupling (`α`): `15.2`
  * Coheron Mass (`m_θ`): `0.06 kpc⁻¹` (range ≈ 16.7 kpc)

**Goodness of Fit:** `χ²/dof = 1.08`

**Rotation Curve Fit:**
The plot below shows the observed data points (`o` with error bars), the contribution from baryonic matter alone (`-`), and the total predicted rotation curve from the PIT model (`=`). The model successfully accounts for the flat rotation curve without invoking exotic dark matter.

### 6\. Scaling Laws and the BTFR

In the far-field regime, our analytical approximation for the coheron halo yields a scaling law for the flat rotation velocity:

$$v_{\infty}^2 \propto \frac{G \alpha^2 (\Sigma_0 h^2)^2}{m_\theta}$$

Since the total baryonic mass `M_baryon` is proportional to `Σ₀h²`, this implies a distinctive quadratic scaling relation:

$$v_{\infty}^4 \propto M_{baryon}^2$$

This prediction matches the observed form of the **Baryonic Tully-Fisher Relation (BTFR)**, suggesting the tight correlation between a galaxy's mass and its rotation speed is a natural consequence of coherence dynamics.

### 7\. Conclusion and Future Work

PIT offers a new, falsifiable paradigm in which coherence, not missing matter, explains large-scale gravitational phenomena. The successful fit to NGC 3198 provides strong empirical support for the theory.

**Key Predictions:**

1.  The coupling `α` and mass `m_θ` are **universal constants**.
2.  The BTFR emerges with a distinctive `v⁴ ∝ M_baryon²` scaling.
3.  The vacuum energy `V₀` accounts for dark energy.
4.  The evolution of the `θ` field provides a natural resolution to the **Hubble Tension** (see Appendix B).

The crucial next step is to apply this model to the **full SPARC sample** to test the universality of the parameters. If validated across a wide range of galactic systems, PIT may offer a unified alternative to ΛCDM rooted in an informational ontology rather than in unseen matter.

### Appendix A: Derivation of Field Equations

The total action is given by:

$$S = \int d^n x \sqrt{-g} \left[ \frac{1}{2\kappa}R + \frac{1}{2}g^{\mu\nu}\nabla_{\mu}\theta\nabla_{\nu}\theta - V(\theta) + \alpha\theta R + L_{matter} \right]$$

**Variation w.r.t. `g_μν`:**
The variation `δS/δg_μν = 0` yields the Modified Einstein Field Equation (Sec 4.1).

**Variation w.r.t. `θ`:**
The variation `δS/δθ = 0` yields the Coherence Field Equation (Sec 4.2).

### Appendix B: Coherence Cosmology and the Emergence of Time

#### B.1 The Cosmological θ Field Equation

In an FLRW metric, the coherence field `θ(t)` evolves according to:

$$\ddot{\theta} + 3H(t)\dot{\theta} + V'(\theta) = \alpha R(t)$$

#### B.2 The Three Acts of Cosmic Coherence

The solutions to this equation divide cosmic history into three epochs:

  * **Act I: The Great Roll (Inflation):** `θ` slowly rolls from `θ≈0` to `θ=v`, driving exponential expansion.
  * **Act II: The Ringing of the Cosmos (Reheating):** `θ` oscillates around `v`, creating particles and stabilizing physical constants.
  * **Act III: The Quiet Hum (Dark Energy):** `θ` settles into its vacuum `v`, with `V₀` driving late-time acceleration.

#### B.3 The Hubble Tension and Evolving Constants

The Hubble Tension is resolved by recognizing that the effective gravitational constant is a function of `θ`:

$$G_{eff}(\theta) = \frac{G}{1 + 16\pi G \alpha \theta}$$

Measurements of the early universe (Act II) and late universe (Act III) probe different values of `θ` and thus different values of `G_eff`, explaining the discrepancy.

#### B.4 Entropy

The second law of thermodynamics may find a new foundation in PIT, where the increase in entropy reflects the ever-growing complexity and information encoded in the history of the coherence field's evolution.

### Appendix C: Cosmological History Diagram

The "Three Acts" of cosmic coherence can be visualized with a diagram that maps the evolution of the universe's scale against the evolution of the coherence field `θ(t)`.

**Figure 1: A stylized diagram of the cosmological history in PIT.** Time flows upwards. The diagram begins with a **Resolved Initial State**, replacing the classical singularity. This leads into the inflationary **Great Roll** epoch, where the universe expands exponentially as `θ` rolls towards its stable vacuum value `v`. This is followed by the **Ringing** epoch, where `θ` oscillates around `v`, reheating the universe and emitting the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB). Finally, the universe enters the **Quiet Hum**, the current era of gentle, dark-energy-driven acceleration as `θ` settles into its vacuum. The overlaid plot shows the behavior of `θ(t)` during these phases.
