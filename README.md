# PITkit: Participatory Interface Theory Research Toolkit

I am rebooting this rep. I hope to put more here later today. Feel free to
browse the history to see what was here. Also, I have done a lot more since the
latest things on the main branch, but those are in my local repo only, so far.
I will likely be borrowing some of the math formulas from there as I redo
things here.
