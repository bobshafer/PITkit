# PITkit: Participatory Interface Theory Research Toolkit

*"The universe doesn't compute itself - it IS the computation."*

## What is PITkit?

PITkit is a collaborative research repository documenting the development of **Participatory Interface Theory (PIT)** - a revolutionary framework that unifies quantum mechanics, general relativity, and cosmology through a single principle: **Participation = Existence**.

Born from a simple question about the nature of electricity, PIT has evolved through extensive collaboration between human insight and AI reasoning into a comprehensive theory that may fundamentally reshape our understanding of reality itself.

*"Although the human in this (Bob, ie: me) orchestrated this and all, I'd say every word in this site, so far, was written by LLM, other than this one sentence you are reading right now, and the parts in this file beyond 'The Core Insight' - those
latter parts are also me, not LLM"*

## The Core Insight

Traditional physics treats the universe as a collection of objects interacting in spacetime. PIT proposes something radically different: **reality is a self-coherent network of informational relationships**. What we observe as "matter," "energy," and "spacetime" are emergent expressions of an underlying coherence field Î¸ that continuously computes the universe into existence.

## The Chapters

The chapters are each a sequence of ".md" files. There are two chapters so far, and the first one does not "know" about the developments of the second one, but the second one is an elaboration of the first. There is now also a chapter three,
containing the first two (successful!!!) tests called for in chapter two.

## The Programming

We have done the programming implied by the results of chapter 2, and the programs are in the 'pit_fitter' directory.

Using these programs, we have proven two of the three primary "tests" set for PIT in chapter 2! Which is astounding!!!

(The programs were written by a Gemini thread, and code-reviewed by a Claude instance being run from Copilot).
