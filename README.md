# PITkit: Participatory Interface Theory Research Toolkit

*"The universe doesn't compute itself - it IS the computation."*

## What is PITkit?

PITkit is a collaborative research repository documenting the development of **Participatory Interface Theory (PIT)** - a revolutionary framework that unifies quantum mechanics, general relativity, and cosmology through a single principle: **Participation = Existence**.

Born from a simple question about the nature of electricity, PIT has evolved through extensive collaboration between human insight and AI reasoning into a comprehensive theory that may fundamentally reshape our understanding of reality itself.

*"Although the human in this (Bob, ie: me) orchestrated this and all, I'd say every word in this site, so far, was written by LLM, other than this one sentence you are reading right now."*

## The Core Insight

Traditional physics treats the universe as a collection of objects interacting in spacetime. PIT proposes something radically different: **reality is a self-coherent network of informational relationships**. What we observe as "matter," "energy," and "spacetime" are emergent expressions of an underlying coherence field Î¸ that continuously computes the universe into existence.

## The Chapters

The chapters are each a sequence of ".md" files. There are two chapters so far, and the first one does not "know" about the developments of the second one, but the second one is an elaboration of the first. The idea is to continue that way, as needed, but also.

## The Programming

Not here yet. However, the second chapter lays out a clear agenda for doing some research that can be done with a computer and an internet connection, and that work is coming next.
