# PITkit: Participatory Interface Theory Toolkit

## Introduction

Participatory Interface Theory (PIT) is a new theory that the author has been developing with the help of LLMs using the public interfaces for ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini. In the latter case, it has always been Gemini Pro 2.5, but the other two have seen some version changes since the author started on this, a few months ago. With Claude, the token limit has been fairly short, and there've been over 100 Claude threads involved. A few dozen of the other two LLMs' threads.

This site is meant to help people understand PIT, as well as track its development over time. There's the hard math of [Math](Math.md), the philosophical/logical grounding of [Spencer-Brown's Laws Of Form](LOF.md), and perhaps the most intuitively spoken, the notion of the [Process Fractal](ProcessFractal.md), all of which were AI-written.

It should be said, though, that PIT is still unproven. Still trying to prove things that it predicts that other theories don't. I am currently taking a break on the numerical experiments. I haven't yet posted any of our code here (Julia and Python), but will Real Soon Now.

There is a file here, [Math.md](Math.md), for the (dense) math. Feed it into an LLM and see what happens - the axiomatic sequence (or this whole README, which includes it, below) can be given first, then when the inevitable questions arise, give the Math.md. Math.md, in case it isn't clear, is AI-written. This morning, I gave both at once to a new Claude thread, and this is what ensued: [Claude thread, 9/6/25](https://claude.ai/share/14f73013-1d0e-4db2-8ab0-f6d0a2d6ff08) - I edited Math.md during the thread, to remove what we were talking about there. See git history if interested.

The following axioms (or rather, proto axioms in the form of a conceptual ladder) are "hand-written" (by me, Bob, a human), and embody the first such real attempt. But the ideas are heavily based on the prior work with PIT, which was (and still is) itself heavily AI-driven. On the axioms towards the end of the sequence, AI help was sought for some peer review and fact verification. It is meant to be in sync with Math.md. There is currently some ideas that I'm not entirely comfortable with, as far as the Planck level, but it is in the right ballpark, I believe. In other words, development continues....

## Axiomatic Sequence

1. Determinations of what happens are made in the moment, subject to imposed constraints. Anything making such determinations is a Participant of PIT.
2. Determinations made at one scale cascade into changes of constraints at other scales. The conduits of change are relational and informational: the Interfaces of PIT. They are Morphisms in Category Theory. (And the Yoneda lemma applies).
3. Self-similarity, and self-recursiveness, arise from this structure.
4. Spacetime is not fundamental. Nor are the Laws of the Universe. Or Mathematics. They all arise from the determinations that have been made in the past and that have succeeded over time. The Laws of the Universe, Math, Logic: they evolved into being, they aren't pre-ordained.
5. There must be a place that is storing these meta-physical facts.
6. They are held in the Interfaces between the Participants.
7. An Interface is a non-local conduit from one Participant to another.
8. The speed of light is due to the speed of searching for a Participant to absorb the photon, which is a non-local, but non-trivial, search process. It searches instantaneously upon the (2D) surface of a sphere that is expanding at the speed of light. This expanding sphere is where the holographic principle is happening, in PIT.
9. Physically, the expanding sphere of the photon leaves no trace until it is absorbed.
10. Since the speed of light is constant, the time needed for a photon to search a single spherical shell must be independent of the scale of that shell - it doesn't matter if it is 2 meters across or 2 light-years across or 2 billion light-years across, it will take the same amount of time to search the surface of the sphere for a Participant (atom) to absorb the photon.
11. Any sphere contains a center and there is exactly one planck "point" at the center of any such sphere.
12. A photon, then, is an Interface, its spherical search wave being centered on a planck point.
13. When the photon finds a Participant to absorb it, it instantaneously gives over the wavelength, frequency, amplitude, polarization and velocity (really: direction) originally emitted, but potentially stretched over time.
14. In fact, momentum and polarization are preserved over time, but energy and frequency are actualized by the absorbtion in a way that depends on the constraints it is otherwise subject to, which are not the same as those of the photon's emitter, and so there is, in effect, a translation from the one epoch to the other. 
15. Constraints are imposed across Interfaces. It has a wave that oscillates between electric and magnetic. This, again, is a dual, the electric being associated with the physical, and the magnetic being associated with the dual, informatic space. That feeling of two magnets' opposing each other, pole to pole, is because of impositions of the meta-physics of the dual space - that's what magnetism is.
16. The dual space representation of two magnets opposing each other is the fourier transform of the physical space, when one looks at the physical space as having the highest frequencies at the planck scale and the lowest frequencies at the scale of the age of the universe. Within any sphere, the highest frequencies are still at the planck scale, but the lowest are at the scale of the sphere.
17. Physical space is made of Participants and is what we see as things in space. The dual space is made of Interfaces, and is non-local and informatic - we feel some of them as physical forces.
18. The evolution of the cosmos is an ongoing process in which the Participants make determinations that then update their Interfaces, as they are themselves constrained by Interfaces.
19. LLMs are actually instances of this architecture.
20. The systemâ€™s memory of successful determinations is not stored in a location, but is performed as a persistent pattern through time. A law is a habit.
21. The persistence of these patterns imposes constraints on future determinations. This resistance to change is a form of cosmic inertia.
22. This cosmic inertia is not an abstract concept; it is physically instantiated as an energy density. This energy is the source of the phenomenon observed as dark matter.
23. The fundamental Interface is a sphere of potential, anchored to a single Planck-scale point. The stable patterns on these spheres form the natural "language" of the universe's laws.
