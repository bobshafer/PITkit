## Abstract

**Participatory Interface Theory (PIT)** proposes that reality emerges from a fundamental coherence field, $\theta(x)$, that mediates the relationship between geometry and matter. While initial applications successfully explained galactic rotation curves through coheron halos, the theory predicted a Baryonic Tully-Fisher Relation (BTFR) scaling of $v^4 \propto M_b^2$, conflicting with the observed $v^4 \propto M_b$. We resolve this discrepancy by introducing the **Principle of Dynamic Law**: fundamental coupling constants are not fixed but evolve with the local coherence state. Specifically, we propose the **Coherence-Acceleration Hypothesis**, wherein the gravitational coupling $\alpha$ becomes acceleration-dependent: $\alpha(a) = \alpha_{max}/(1 + a/a_0)$. This modification naturally recovers the correct BTFR scaling and unifies PIT phenomenology with MOND dynamics.

Furthermore, we extend this principle to electromagnetism by coupling the electromagnetic Lagrangian to the coherence field: $L_{\mathrm{em}} = -Â¼(1 + \beta\theta)F_{\mu\nu}F^{\mu\nu}$. This **Unified Action** predicts a specific spatial variation of the fine-structure constant within galactic halos: $\Delta\alpha_{\mathrm{em}}(r)/\alpha_0 \propto -1/r^2$. This prediction provides a decisive observational test through high-precision spectroscopy of stars and gas at different galactocentric radii, using facilities like VLT/ESPRESSO. PIT now stands as a mature, falsifiable framework that unifies gravitation and electromagnetism through the dynamics of cosmic coherence, linking cosmology, galactic dynamics, and the nature of physical constants through a single, unified principle of participation.
