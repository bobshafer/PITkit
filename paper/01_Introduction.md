## 1. Introduction: From Discrepancy to Unification

Modern cosmology rests on the highly successful but deeply puzzling ΛCDM model, a framework that requires 95% of the universe's energy budget to consist of two unknown entities: **dark matter** and **dark energy**. Despite decades of extensive experimental searches, no direct evidence for a dark matter particle has been found, suggesting that our foundational understanding of gravity and matter may be incomplete.

**Participatory Interface Theory (PIT)** was proposed as a new paradigm built from first principles, starting with the axiom **Participation = Existence**. This framework posits a fundamental scalar **coherence field, `θ`**, whose dynamics and coupling to spacetime geometry give rise to the phenomena we attribute to the "dark sector." The initial formulation of PIT, a static model based on a constant coupling `α`, demonstrated remarkable success in fitting the rotation curve of individual galaxies, such as NGC 3198.

However, a crucial test for any theory of galactic dynamics is the **Baryonic Tully-Fisher Relation (BTFR)**, the tight empirical law connecting a galaxy's total baryonic mass (`$M_b$`) to the flat part of its rotation curve (`$v_f$`). The observed relation is `$M_b \propto v_f^4$`. The initial, simplified PIT model predicted a scaling of `$M_b^2 \propto v_f^4$`, a significant discrepancy.

Such moments are not failures but opportunities for theoretical advancement. This paper demonstrates that this discrepancy is resolved by introducing a deeper principle within the PIT framework: the **Principle of Dynamic Law**. This leads to the **Coherence-Acceleration Hypothesis**, the idea that the coupling between matter and the coherence field is not a constant, but is a dynamic variable dependent on the local gravitational environment. We will show that this single refinement not only recovers the correct BTFR scaling but also forges a profound and testable link between the laws of gravity and the laws of electromagnetism.
