# Participatory Interface Theory — Seed Crystal / Loom Spec

---

## Purpose

This document is a minimal, lossless handoff artifact for:

- LLM ↔ LLM collaboration
- human ↔ machine reasoning
- cross-domain PIT applications

It encodes invariants, switches, and tests, not prose.

---

## Core Invariants

1. **Continuation Imperative** — The system must always maintain a non-empty continuation set.
2. **Cost–Coherence Duality** — $D = -\ln \mu$
3. **History is Expensive** — Persistent structure implies irreversibility and cost.

---

## Modes

### Mode A (Elastic)

- Reversible
- No memory written
- Interference allowed
- $\xi < \xi_{\mathrm{crit}}$

### Mode B (Plastic)

- Irreversible
- Memory written
- Decoherence
- $\xi \ge \xi_{\mathrm{crit}}$

---

## Strain

Strain is the control parameter.

Generic form (display):

$$
\xi = \frac{\mathrm{Demand}}{\mathrm{Capacity}}
$$

Only strain, not raw volume, triggers regime change.

## KIUAN (Kick It Up A Notch)

**Trigger:** No viable continuation exists under the current representation.

**Action:**

- Extend the state space
- Add degrees of freedom
- Refine the mesh
- Change abstraction level

**Examples:**

- Big Bang
- Measurement
- Organizational reconfiguration
- Algorithmic redesign

## Light (PIT Definition)

Light is the elastic messaging layer. It propagates because it does not trigger Mode B recording.

- $c$ is the maximum elastic propagation speed.
- Plastic effects slow clocks without changing local light speed.

---

## Gravity (PIT Interpretation)

- Mass = accumulated hysteresis
- Gravity = processing lag due to high strain
- Time dilation = reduced local update rate

This parameterizes GR, it does not derive it.

---

## Quantum Mechanics (PIT Interpretation)

- Superposition = Mode A exploration
- Measurement = strain-induced Mode B commit
- Wavefunction = stress distribution over continuations

---

## Failure / Singularities

- Failure = $wp = 0$
- Physical singularities = representational failure
- Required response = KIUAN, not extrapolation

---

## Falsifiability Hooks

Domains where PIT predicts mode-dependent behavior:

- Urban response systems (311)
- Financial crashes
- Network congestion
- Measurement-induced decoherence
- Horizon-adjacent physics

Prediction pattern:

High strain ⇒ coherent hysteresis

Low strain ⇒ memoryless response

## Motto

Necessity is the Mother of Invention.

The Universe is Necessary.
